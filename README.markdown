First off, remember that by following these instructions you may brick your CBC and void your warranty.  You have been warned.
CBCv2 ONLY

Ubuntu Guide (should be similar for other *nix operating systems):

To build (assuming you already have a JDK installed):
        sudo apt-get install git-core ant maven2
        git clone git://github.com/catron/CBCJVM.git
        cd CBCJVM
        sh BuildEverything.sh

Congrats! You should now have everything you need in `CBCJVM/installer/install`!!1!
See corresponding Readme.txt file.

        cd CBCJVM
        git pull
        sh BuildEverything.sh
        ... and reinstall on cbc

Documentation (generated upon build) is located at `CBCJVM/cbc/CBCJVM/docs/api` see the [wiki](http://wiki.github.com/catron/CBCJVM/) for more information

When compiling or running custom code, be sure to set `CBCJVM/cbc/CBCJVM/bin` as your classpath!

You can use maven to build the tests and to build your own programs!
Just CD into the test directory, and provided it has a good pom.xml file (still cleaning them up and adding them to old tests) and run `mvn clean install`
